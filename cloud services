Using cloud services share responsibility of management kind of things 
Thus we have 3 models based on shared responsibility
1. IaaS- Infrastructure as service:
No Opex Cost
Agile
Flexibilty
Cloud benefit
Pay as per use

But requires management of thing like operating system updates, setup , firewall ,security management


2. PaaS - Platforn as service: 
Same benefit like IaaS just dependancy of platform management means problematic when some software require specific operatiing system.
And this model doesn't include handling of security and operating system.
It focus on productivity

3. SaaS - Software as service:
Ex. Hosted softwares that we use on subscription basis like MSOffice
So don't need to care about hosting , management
No upfront cost, Pay as per use
